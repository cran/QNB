Description: We present QNB, a statistical approach for differential RNA 
            methylation analysis with count-based small-sample sequencing 
             data. The method is based on 4 independent negative binomial 
             distributions, and with their variances and means linked by 
             local regressions, respectively. Please don't hesitate to 
             contact <liulian19860905@163.com> if you have any questions.
